function outputWeights = wiener_hopf(stateCollectMat, teachCollectMat)
% computes ESN output weights from collected network states and collected 
% teacher outputs. Mathematically this is a linear regression. 
% Uses the Wiener-Hopf solution, which runs faster (but is less numerically
% stable) than if the weights are computed via the pseudoinverse.
